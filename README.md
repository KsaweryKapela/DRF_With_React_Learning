# Tech_Learning_Organizer
App that helps organize set up your learning goals in IT department.
Created with Django Rest Framework and React.

I consider this project finished for now, a quick summary:
1. Managed to create nice registration system with email confirmation.
2. Created API that provide database data.
3. Did validation classes.
4. Learned most of the React basics and created multiple quasi-user-friendly forms.

The big failure of the project was using webpacks and Django templating to work with React.
I should've instead used React router and only use Django as API.
Definitly will improve on that in future projects.
